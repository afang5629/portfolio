          I currently attend Carleton University as a 2nd year computer science student. 
          In my free time I enjoy playing games, mainly FPS and story driven.
          Watching anime and dramas is another one of my biggest pass times.
          You can find me listening to music often, stretching genres from Jpop, Kpop, Cpop, Pop, Rap, Jazz, instrumental. <br/><br/>
          Currently I am learning API implementation to achieve Steam API integration into my personal website. <br/>
          I'm also learning the fundamentals of game development through my developement of a Tetris clone.
